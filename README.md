I would like to create a web app. It is called ReAlign and is specified on a modern coding basis. You should first go through the login/register process with Github or by e-mail and password. Then you enter the app, which displays the main point, the dashboard. There are sub-items such as Projects, Chat, Calendar, Documents and Settings.

The dashboard displays calendar entries, open to-dos, code reviews and changes in the projects.

In the project section, you can create projects and also invite users. It should also be possible to clone or mirror Github projects. 
The projects have a more complex structure. There are these sub-items below:
Repositories, Issue Boards, Code Reviews, Cron Jobs, Contributors, Project Settings

In the chat, you can chat with other people and create your own team channels.

The calendar is an overview of planned meetings and tickets from the issue board.

Documents can be stored in the documents and folder systems can be created.

The settings are there for color schemes and for setting the language. There are also profile settings.
